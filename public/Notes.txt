For animated demo images on your project cards, here are the best options ranked by effort:

Screen-recorded GIFs (easiest, most common) — Use a tool like CleanShot X (Mac) or ScreenToGif (free) to record 5-10 second clips of each project in action, export as .gif or .webm. Drop them in public/images/projects/ and swap the thumbnailUrl in projects.json. Your Retro Rumble repo already has a gifs/ directory you can use.

Lottie animations — Create or commission short animations in After Effects or Figma, export as Lottie JSON. Libraries like lottie-react render them smoothly. Great for a polished feel but more effort.

CSS/Framer Motion mockups — For projects without a visual UI (like RAgent's API), create a styled "browser frame" component with a scrolling code snippet or terminal animation. No external assets needed.

Auto-playing <video> tags — Record .mp4 screen captures (better quality than GIF, smaller files). Use <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline> in the card component. This is what most high-end portfolio sites do.

My recommendation: Option 4 (.mp4 videos) for the best quality/size ratio, with option 1 (GIFs) as a quick start. You'd record each project, trim to ~5-8 seconds, and I can update the ProjectCard component to support video thumbnails alongside static images.
